# hackviser-CAPT-sql_injection_exam-
In the CAPT certification course in Hackviser, there is a module about sql injection. This repo will help you find answers to those questions, providing scripts that will be ready to run so that you could have the answers.
I will start off by the question 12, this is the first question where one has to interact with the machine. The question is: What is the name of the database that the web application is connected to?

You first have to find the characters in the database name, then test each character against every position to get the database name.
